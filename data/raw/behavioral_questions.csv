question,answer
"Tell me about yourself.","Start with the present and tell why you are well qualified for the position. Remember that the key to all successful interviewing is to match your qualifications to what the interviewer is looking for. Before answering, try to uncover the interviewer's greatest need, want, problem or goal by asking for a more complete description of what the position entails. Follow up with second and third questions to draw out their needs. After uncovering what the employer is looking for, describe why the needs of this job bear striking parallels to tasks you've succeeded at before. Be sure to illustrate with specific examples of your responsibilities and especially your achievements, all geared to present yourself as a perfect match for the needs described."
"What are your greatest strengths?","You should have a list mentally prepared of your greatest strengths with specific examples that illustrate each strength, chosen from your most recent and impressive achievements. Once you uncover your interviewer's greatest wants and needs, choose those achievements from your list that best match up. The 10 most desirable traits employers seek are: 1) A proven track record as an achiever, especially matching the employer's needs; 2) Intelligence and management savvy; 3) Honesty, integrity, being a decent human being; 4) Good fit with corporate culture and being a team player; 5) Likeability, positive attitude, sense of humor; 6) Good communication skills; 7) Dedication and willingness to go the extra mile; 8) Definiteness of purpose and clear goals; 9) Enthusiasm and high motivation; 10) Confidence, health, and leadership."
"What are your greatest weaknesses?","Never confess a weakness or fault. Assure the interviewer that you can think of nothing that would stand in the way of your performing with excellence. Based on what they've told you about the position, you believe you'd make an outstanding match. When you hire people, you look for two things: Do they have the qualifications to do the job well, and the motivation to do it well? Everything in your background shows you have both. An alternate strategy if you don't know enough about the position: Instead of confessing a weakness, describe what you like most and like least, making sure what you like most matches the most important qualification for success, and what you like least is not essential."
"Tell me about something you did or failed to do that you now feel a little ashamed of.","Never confess a regret. Say you harbor no regrets, then add a principle or habit you practice regularly for healthy human relations. For example: At the end of each day, mentally review the day's events and conversations to take a second look at people and developments you're involved with and do a double-check of what they're likely to be feeling. Sometimes you'll see things that need more follow-up. You also like to make each person feel like a member of an elite team. If you let each team member know you expect excellence, work hard to set an example yourself, and let people know you appreciate and respect their feelings, you wind up with a highly motivated group striving for excellence rather than brooding over slights or regrets."
"Why are you leaving (or did you leave) this position?","Never badmouth your previous industry, company, board, boss, staff, employees or customers. This rule is inviolable: never be negative. If you have a job presently and aren't 100% committed to leaving, don't be afraid to say so. State honestly what you'd be hoping to find in a new spot, matching your desires to the position if you've uncovered what it's about. If you don't have a job, never lie about being fired. Describe your firing candidly, succinctly and without bitterness from the company's point-of-view, indicating you could understand why it happened and might have made the same decision yourself. This shows you are healed from the wounds and are first-class management material. For all prior positions, have brief reasons prepared: more money, opportunity, responsibility or growth."
"The Silent Treatment - What do you do when the interviewer just stares at you in silence after you answer?","Like a primitive tribal mask, the Silent Treatment loses all its power to frighten you once you refuse to be intimidated. If your interviewer pulls it, keep quiet yourself for a while and then ask, with sincere politeness and not a trace of sarcasm, 'Is there anything else I can fill in on that point?' Don't let the Silent Treatment intimidate you into talking excessively, because you could easily talk yourself out of the position."
"Why should I hire you?","By now you should know the employer's greatest needs and desires. This question gives you a big advantage because you will give better reasons for hiring you than anyone else, reasons tied directly to their needs. Walk through each of the position's requirements as you understand them, and follow each with a reason why you meet that requirement so well. Every one of these selling points (their need matched by your qualifications) runs up your score. This is your best opportunity to outsell your competition."
"Aren't you overqualified for this position?","Agree on the importance of this qualification, but explain that your strength may be greater than your resume indicates. When this strength is added to your other strengths, it's really your combination of qualifications that's most important. Then shift focus to review your greatest strengths that match up most favorably with the company's most urgently-felt wants and needs. You recognize the job market is tight, understand supply and demand. You could start contributing right away, perhaps faster than someone less experienced. The company gets all the value of your training and experience without paying extra for it. From your side, you're unemployed and want to work very much. The position is exactly what you love to do and are best at. You're looking to make a long-term commitment. If you perform with excellence, other opportunities will open up."
"Where do you see yourself five years from now?","Reassure your interviewer that you're looking to make a long-term commitment. This position entails exactly what you're looking for and what you do extremely well. In terms of your future career path, you're confident that if you do your work with excellence, opportunities will inevitably open up for you. It's always been that way in your career, and you're confident you'll have similar opportunities here."
"Describe your ideal company, location and job.","The only right answer is to describe what this company is offering, being sure to make your answer believable with specific reasons, stated with sincerity, why each quality represented by this opportunity is attractive to you. If you're coming from a company that's a leader in its field or a glamorous company, remember the interviewer may have an 'Avis complex' - feeling defensive about being second best. Go out of your way to put their virtues high on your list, providing credible reasons for wanting these qualities."
"Why do you want to work at our company?","This is your opportunity to hit the ball out of the park, thanks to in-depth research you should do before any interview. Best sources: annual reports, corporate newsletter, contacts you know at the company or its suppliers, advertisements, articles about the company in the trade press."
"What are your career options right now?","Prepare to position yourself as a desired commodity. If still working, describe possibilities at your present firm and why, though greatly appreciated there, you're looking for something more (challenge, money, responsibility, etc.). Mention you're seriously exploring opportunities with one or two other firms. If not working, you can talk about other employment possibilities you're actually exploring, but do this with a light touch, speaking only in general terms. You don't want to seem manipulative or coy."
"Why have you been out of work so long?","Emphasize factors which have prolonged your job search by your own choice. After your job was terminated, you made a conscious decision not to jump on the first opportunities to come along. You decided to take whatever time needed to think through what you do best, what you most want to do, where you'd like to do it, and then identify companies that could offer such an opportunity. Also factor in the recession/consolidation/downsizing in your industry. Between being selective and companies downsizing, the process has taken time. But when you find the right match, all that careful evaluation from both sides will have been worthwhile for both the company and yourself."
"Tell me honestly about the strong points and weak points of your boss (company, management team, etc.).","Remember the rule: Never be negative. Stress only the good points, no matter how charmingly you're invited to be critical. Your interviewer doesn't care about your previous boss. They want to find out how loyal and positive you are, and whether you'll criticize them behind their back if pressed to do so by someone in their own company. This is your opportunity to demonstrate your loyalty to those you work with."
"What good books have you read lately?","Unless you're up for a position in academia or as book critic, you're not expected to be a literary lion. But it wouldn't hurt to have read a handful of the most recent and influential books in your profession and on management. Make sure they are quality books that reflect favorably upon you. Add a recently published bestselling work of fiction by a world-class author and you'll pass this question with flying colors."
"Tell me about a situation when your work was criticized.","Begin by emphasizing the extremely positive feedback you've gotten throughout your career and that your performance reviews have been uniformly excellent. Of course, no one is perfect and you always welcome suggestions on how to improve. Give an example of a not-too-damaging learning experience from early in your career and relate how this lesson has since helped you. This demonstrates you learned from the experience and the lesson is now one of the strongest parts of your skill set. If pressed for a recent criticism, choose something fairly trivial that in no way is essential to your successful performance. Add that you've learned from this and it's no longer an area of concern."
"What are your outside interests?","Try to gauge how this company's culture would look upon your favorite outside activities and be guided accordingly. You can use this question to shatter stereotypes that could limit your chances. If you're over 50, describe activities that demonstrate physical stamina. If you're young, mention an activity that connotes wisdom and institutional trust. But above all, remember that your employer is hiring you for what you can do for them, not your family, yourself or outside organizations."
"Fatal flaw question - You don't have a college degree / You've been out of the job market / You never earned your CPA, etc.","Be completely honest, open and straightforward about admitting the shortcoming. Do not apologize or try to explain it away. Add that as desirable as such a qualification might be, its lack has made you work harder throughout your career and has not prevented you from compiling an outstanding track record of achievements. Give examples of how, through relentless commitment to excellence, you have consistently outperformed those who do have this qualification. The ultimate way to handle fatal flaw questions is to prevent them by uncovering the employer's needs and matching your qualifications to those needs."
"How do you feel about reporting to a younger person (minority, woman, etc.)?","You greatly admire a company that hires and promotes on merit alone and couldn't agree more with that philosophy. The age, gender, race, etc. of the person you report to would certainly make no difference to you. Whoever has that position has obviously earned it and knows their job well. Both the person and the position are fully deserving of respect. You believe all people in a company work best when their abilities, efforts and feelings are respected and rewarded fairly, and that includes you. That's the best type of work environment you can hope to find."
"On confidential matters - Tell me about confidential information from your current/former employer.","Never reveal anything truly confidential about a present or former employer. Explain your reticence diplomatically: 'I certainly want to be as open as I can about that. But I also wish to respect the rights of those who have trusted me with their most sensitive information, just as you would hope to be able to trust any of your key people when talking with a competitor.' You can allude to your finest achievements in specific ways that don't reveal confidential information. Be guided by the golden rule: if you were the owner of your present company, would you feel it ethically wrong for the information to be given to competitors? If so, refuse to reveal it. Always choose integrity over cooperation in such conflicts."
"Would you lie for the company?","Try to avoid choosing between two values by giving a positive statement that covers all bases: 'I would never do anything to hurt the company.' If aggressively pressed to choose between loyalty and integrity, always choose personal integrity. It is the most prized of all values."
"Looking back, what would you do differently in your life?","Indicate that you are a happy, fulfilled, optimistic person and that, in general, you wouldn't change a thing. It's been a good life, rich in learning and experience, and the best is yet to come. Every experience in life is a lesson in its own way. You wouldn't change a thing."
"Could you have done better in your last job?","Again, never be negative. With the benefit of hindsight you can always find things to do better, but off the top of your head, you can't think of anything of major consequence. If more explanation seems necessary, describe a situation that didn't suffer because of you but from external conditions beyond your control, and what you learned from it."
"Can you work under pressure?","Absolutely. Then prove it with a vivid example or two of a goal or project accomplished under severe pressure."
"What makes you angry?","Give an answer suited to both your personality and the management style of the firm. If you're reserved or the culture is coolly professional, say you're an even-tempered and positive person by nature, and this helps you keep your department running smoothly. You believe in communicating clearly what's expected, getting commitment, and following up continuously. If anyone is going off track, you want to know early. After open communication and follow-up, if someone isn't getting the job done with no good reason, you'll get impatient and angry and take appropriate steps. If you're feisty or the position calls for toughness, say what makes you angry: people who don't pull their weight, who are negative, who lie, etc."
"Why aren't you earning more money at this stage of your career?","You like to make money, but other factors are even more important. Making money is very important and one reason you're here is to make more. Throughout your career, what's been even more important is doing work you really like to do at the kind of company you like and respect. Then be prepared to be specific about what your ideal position and company would be like, matching them as closely as possible to the opportunity at hand."
"Who has inspired you in your life and why?","Have a few heroes in mind from your mental 'Board of Directors' - leaders in your industry, from history or anyone else who has been your mentor. Be prepared to give examples of how their words, actions or teachings have helped inspire your achievements. Prepare an answer which highlights qualities that would be highly valued in the position you are seeking."
"What was the toughest decision you ever had to make?","Be prepared with a good example, explaining why the decision was difficult, the process you followed in reaching it, the courageous or effective way you carried it out, and the beneficial results."
"Tell me about the most boring job you've ever had.","You have never allowed yourself to grow bored with a job and can't understand it when others let themselves fall into that rut. Perhaps you've been fortunate, but you've never found yourself bored with any job you have ever held. You've always enjoyed hard work. You believe that in every company or department there are exciting challenges and intriguing problems crying out for energetic and enthusiastic solutions. If you're bored, it's probably because you're not challenging yourself to tackle those problems right under your nose."
"Have you been absent from work more than a few days in any previous position?","If you have had no problem, emphasize your excellent and consistent attendance record throughout your career. Describe how important you believe such consistent attendance is for a key executive - why it's up to you to set an example of dedication and why there's just no substitute for being there with your people. If you do have a past attendance problem, minimize it, making clear it was an exceptional circumstance and its cause has been corrected. State your excellent attendance record otherwise and your belief in the importance of consistent attendance."
"What changes would you make if you came on board?","You wouldn't be a very good doctor if you gave your diagnosis before the examination. Should you be hired, you'd want to take a good hard look at everything the company is doing and understand why it's being done that way. You'd like to have in-depth meetings with key people to get a deeper grasp of what they feel is being done right and what could be improved. From what you've been told so far, the areas of greatest concern are... (name them, then ask if these are in fact the major concerns, and reaffirm how your experience in meeting similar needs elsewhere might prove very helpful)."
"I'm concerned that you don't have as much experience as we'd like in...","Before any interview, try to identify the weakest aspects of your candidacy from this company's point of view and prepare the best answer possible. When the interviewer poses this objection: 1) Agree on the importance of this qualification; 2) Explain that your strength may be greater than your resume indicates; 3) When this strength is added to your other strengths, it's really your combination of qualifications that's most important. Then review the areas of your greatest strengths that match up most favorably with the company's most urgently-felt wants and needs. This shifts focus from one isolated area to the unique combination of strengths you offer."
"How do you feel about working nights and weekends?","If you're a confirmed workaholic, say this kind of schedule is just your style and your family understands. If you prefer a more balanced lifestyle, ask 'What's the norm for your best people here?' If the hours still sound unrealistic, ask if they have top performers who also have families and like to get home in time to see them. Depending on the answer, be honest about how you would fit in. Say you love your work and do it exceptionally well, working not just hard but smart. You have a family who likes to see you after work and on weekends. They add balance to your life, which helps you be happy and productive at work. If you could handle some extra work at home in evenings or weekends, that would be ideal."
"Are you willing to relocate or travel?","First find out where you may have to relocate and how much travel may be involved. Then respond. If there's no problem, say so enthusiastically. If you do have a reservation, you can either keep your options open by saying 'no problem' and deciding later when you have the full offer, or voice a reservation but assert you'd be open to relocating or traveling for the right opportunity. Your strategy depends on how eager you are for the job."
"Do you have the stomach to fire people? Have you had experience firing many people?","Describe the rational and sensible management process you follow in both hiring and firing. Your whole management approach is to hire the best people you can find, train them thoroughly and well, get them excited and proud to be part of your team, and work with them to achieve goals together. If you do all that right, especially hiring the right people, you don't have to fire very often. So firing is a last resort. But when it's got to be done, it's got to be done quickly and cleanly. A poor employee can wreak terrible damage in undermining the morale of an entire team. When there's no other way, you've found it's better for all concerned to act decisively."
"Why have you had so many jobs?","Before the interview, try to minimize your image as job hopper on your resume. Consider eliminating less important positions under one year, or specifying time in rounded years rather than months and years. In the interview, reassure the interviewer by describing each position as part of an overall pattern of growth and career development. Be careful not to blame other people for your frequent changes, but you can attribute certain changes to conditions beyond your control. Show that job changes were more frequent in your younger days while establishing yourself, and that you're now much more interested in the best long-term opportunity. Cite the job(s) where you stayed longest and describe that type of situation as what you're looking for now."
"What do you see as the proper role/mission of a good (job title/manager/executive/company in the industry)?","Think of the most essential ingredients of success for each category. Identify at least three but no more than six qualities you feel are most important to success in each role. Commit your response to memory. The more information you've drawn out about the interviewer's greatest wants and needs, and the more homework you've done to identify the culture of the firm, the more on-target your answer will be."
"What would you say to your boss if he's crazy about an idea, but you think it stinks?","Remember: In any conflict between values, always choose integrity. When evaluating anything, it's important to emphasize the positive - what you like about the idea. Then, if you have reservations, point them out as specifically, objectively and factually as you can. After all, the most important thing you owe your boss is honesty. If they can't count on you for that, everything else you do or say could be questionable. But also express thoughts constructively. Your goal would be to see if you and your boss could make the idea even stronger, so it effectively overcomes any initial reservations. Of course, if they overrule you and say to do it their way, then you owe them your full and enthusiastic support to make it work as best it can."
"How could you have improved your career progress?","You're generally quite happy with your career progress. Maybe if you had known something earlier in life (impossible to know at the time, such as booming growth in a branch of your industry or corporate downsizing that would phase out your last job), you might have moved in a certain direction sooner. But all things considered, you take responsibility for where you are, how you've gotten there, where you are going, and you harbor no regrets."
"What would you do if a fellow executive on your own corporate level wasn't pulling their weight and this was hurting your department?","Try to gauge the political style of the firm and be guided accordingly. In general, fall back on universal principles of effective human relations. Good human relations would call for you to go directly to the person and explain the situation, to try to enlist their help in a constructive, positive solution. If you sensed resistance, you would be as persuasive as you know how to explain the benefits of working together and the problems that will result if you don't. If they still didn't change, you wouldn't let the problem slide. You would try again and again, involving wider circles of people both above and below the offending executive and including your own boss if necessary, so everyone can see the rewards for teamwork and the drawbacks of non-cooperation. You've never come across a situation that couldn't be resolved by harnessing others in a determined, constructive effort."
"You've been with your firm a long time. Won't it be hard switching to a new company?","To overcome this objection, point to the many ways you have grown and adapted to changing conditions at your present firm. It has not been a static situation. Highlight the different responsibilities you've held and wide array of new situations you've faced and conquered. As a result, you've learned to adapt quickly to whatever is thrown at you, and you thrive on the stimulation of new challenges. To further reassure, describe the similarities between the new position and your prior one. You should be quite comfortable working there, since their needs and your skills make a perfect match."
"May I contact your present employer for a reference?","Express your concern that you'd like to keep your job search private, but that in time, it will be perfectly okay. Your present employer is not aware of your job search and, for obvious reasons, you'd prefer to keep it that way. You'd be most appreciative if you kept the discussion confidential right now. Of course, when you both agree the time is right, then by all means they should contact them. You're very proud of your record there."
"Give me an example of your creativity (analytical skill, managing ability, etc.).","You should have committed to memory a list of your greatest and most recent achievements, ever ready on the tip of your tongue. If you have such a list, it's easy to present any of your achievements in light of the quality the interviewer is asking about. For example, a smashing success you orchestrated at last year's trade show could be used as an example of creativity, analytical ability, or your ability to manage."
"Where could you use some improvement?","Keep this answer positive. A good way to answer is to identify a cutting-edge branch of your profession (one that's not essential to your employer's needs) as an area you're very excited about and want to explore more fully over the next six months."
"What do you worry about?","Redefine the word 'worry' so it does not reflect negatively on you. You wouldn't call it worry, but you are a strongly goal-oriented person. So you keep turning over in your mind anything that seems to be keeping you from achieving those goals, until you find a solution. That's part of your tenacity."
"How many hours a week do you normally work?","Don't give a specific number. If you are a workaholic and sense this company would like that, say you are a confirmed workaholic who often works nights and weekends, and your family accepts this because it makes you fulfilled. If you are not a workaholic, say you have always worked hard and put in long hours. It goes with the territory. In one sense, it's hard to keep track of the hours because your work is a labor of love - you enjoy nothing more than solving problems. So you're almost always thinking about your work, including times at home, while commuting, etc."
"What's the most difficult part of being a (job title)?","First, redefine 'difficult' to be 'challenging' which is more positive. Then, identify an area everyone in your profession considers challenging and in which you excel. Describe the process you follow that enables you to get splendid results and be specific about those results. For example: 'I think every sales manager finds it challenging to motivate the troops in a recession. But that's probably the strongest test of a top sales manager. I feel this is one area where I excel. When I see the first sign that sales may slip or that sales force motivation is flagging because of a downturn in the economy, here's the plan I put into action immediately...' (followed by description of each step in the process and the exceptional results achieved)."
"The Hypothetical Problem - How would you handle this difficult situation?","Don't fall into the trap of trying to solve this problem and giving your verdict on the spot, as it's virtually impossible to have all the facts from such a short presentation. Instead, describe the rational, methodical process you would follow in analyzing this problem, who you would consult with, generating possible solutions, choosing the best course of action, and monitoring the results. Remember, in all 'What would you do?' questions, always describe your process or working methods, and you'll never go wrong."
"What was the toughest challenge you've ever faced?","Have a recent example ready that demonstrates either: 1) A quality most important to the job at hand; or 2) A quality that is always in demand, such as leadership, initiative, managerial skill, persuasiveness, courage, persistence, intelligence, etc."
"Have you considered starting your own business?","Gauge this company's corporate culture before answering and be honest. If the culture is that of a large, formal, military-style structure, minimize any indication that you'd love to have your own business. Say you may have given it a thought once or twice, but your whole career has been in larger organizations where you have excelled and where you want to be. If the culture is more free-wheeling, emphasize that in a firm like this, you can get the best of all worlds - the excitement of seeing your own ideas take shape combined with the resources and stability of a well-established organization. In any case, indicate that any desires about running your own show are part of your past, not your present or future."
"What are your goals?","Many executives who might hire you are strong believers in goal-setting. Be ready to discuss your goals for each major area of your life: career, personal development and learning, family, physical health, community service and (if your interviewer is clearly religious) you could briefly allude to your spiritual goals. Be prepared to describe each goal in terms of specific milestones you wish to accomplish, time periods you're allotting, why the goal is important to you, and specific steps you're taking to bring it about. Do this concisely - never talk more than two minutes straight before letting your interviewer back into the conversation."
"What do you look for when you hire people?","Speak your own thoughts, but weave them around the three most important qualifications for any position: 1) Can the person do the work (qualifications)?; 2) Will the person do the work (motivation)?; 3) Will the person fit in (team player)?"
"Sell me this stapler (or some other object on interviewer's desk).","You already know the most important secret of great salesmanship: find out what people want, then show them how to get it. Say: 'Well, a good salesman must know both his product and his prospect before he sells anything. If I were selling this, I'd first get to know everything I could about it, all its features and benefits. Then, if my goal were to sell it to you, I would do some research on how you might use this item. The best way to do that is by asking some questions. May I ask you a few questions?' Then ask questions like 'Just out of curiosity, if you didn't already have one, why would you want one? And in addition to that? Any other reason?' Ask questions that point to the features this item has. Once you've asked these questions, make your presentation citing all the features and benefits and why it's exactly what the interviewer just told you they're looking for. Then close with 'Just out of curiosity, what would you consider a reasonable price for a quality item like this that would solve all those problems?' Whatever they say (unless it's zero), say 'Okay, we've got a deal.'"
"The Salary Question - How much money do you want?","For maximum salary negotiating power, remember these five guidelines: 1) Never bring up salary - let the interviewer do it first; 2) If the interviewer raises salary too early before you've created desire for your qualifications, postpone the question; 3) The #1 rule of negotiation is: the side with more information wins. Get the employer talking about what they're willing to pay before you reveal what you're willing to accept by asking 'I'm sure the company has already established a salary range for this position. Could you tell me what that is?' or 'What does this position pay?'; 4) Know beforehand what you'd accept - research the job market and this position, remembering most executives look for a 20-25% pay boost when switching jobs; 5) Never lie about what you currently make, but feel free to include the estimated cost of all your fringes, which could add 25-50% more to your present cash-only salary."
"Illegal Question - Questions about age, children, marital status, religion, political affiliation, ancestry, national origin, birthplace, disabilities, clubs, etc.","You can handle an illegal question in several ways: 1) Assert your legal right not to answer (but this will destroy rapport); 2) Answer straightforwardly if you feel the answer could help you; 3) Diplomatically answer the concern behind the question without answering the question itself. For example, if asked about age and you're over 50, you can ask with a friendly smile whether there's a concern that your age may affect your performance, then reassure them there's nothing in this job you can't do. In fact, your age and experience are the most important advantages you offer. Most importantly, remember that illegal questions arise from fear that you won't perform well. The best answer of all is to get the job and perform brilliantly."
"The Secret Illegal Question - Unspoken concerns about your ability to handle the job due to being physically challenged, a single mother, over 50, a minority, etc.","Just because the interviewer doesn't ask an illegal question doesn't mean they don't have concerns. Make sure there's enough counterbalancing information to more than reassure them there's no problem in the area they may be doubtful about. For example, if you're a sales rep who uses a cane and you're concerned the interviewer may secretly wonder about your stamina or ability to travel, make sure you hit these abilities very hard, leaving no doubt about your capacity to handle them well. Without seeming defensive, mention strengths, accomplishments, preferences and affiliations that strongly counterbalance any unspoken concern your interviewer may have."
"What was the toughest part of your last job?","State that there was nothing in your prior position that you found overly difficult, and let your answer go at that. If pressed to expand, describe the aspects of the position you enjoyed more than others, making sure you express maximum enjoyment for those tasks most important to the open position, and you enjoyed least those tasks that are unimportant to the position at hand."
"How do you define success and how do you measure up to your own definition?","Give a well-accepted definition of success that leads right into your own stellar collection of achievements. For example: 'The best definition I've come across is that success is the progressive realization of a worthy goal. As to how I would measure up to that definition, I would consider myself both successful and fortunate...' Then summarize your career goals and how your achievements have indeed represented a progressive path toward realization of your goals."
"The Opinion Question - What do you think about abortion, the President, the death penalty, or any other controversial subject?","If you are ever uncomfortable with any question, asking a question in return is the greatest escape hatch ever invented. Simply responding 'Why do you ask?' will usually be enough to dissipate any pressure to give your opinion. If your interviewer again presses you for an opinion, you can ask another question or assert a generality that almost everyone would agree with. For example, if your interviewer is complaining about politicians then asks if you're a Republican or Democrat, you could respond by saying 'Actually, I'm finding it hard to find any politicians I like these days.'"
"If you won $10 million lottery, would you still work?","Focus on your positive feelings about work. After you floated down from cloud nine, you would still hold your basic belief that achievement and purposeful work are essential to a happy, productive life. After all, if money alone bought happiness, then all rich people would be happy, and that's not true. You love the work you do, and you think you'd always want to be involved in your career in some fashion. Winning the lottery would make it more fun because it would mean having more flexibility, more options. Of course, since you can't count on winning, you'd just as soon create your own destiny by sticking with what's worked for you: good old reliable hard work and a desire to achieve. Those qualities have built many more fortunes than all the lotteries put together."
"Looking back on your last position, have you done your best work?","To cover both possible paths this question can take, your answer should state that you always try to do your best, and the best of your career is right now.

However, don't give a numerical rating. Simply praise whatever interview style they've been using. If they've been tough, say 'You have been thorough and tough-minded, the very qualities needed to conduct a good interview.' If they've been methodical, say 'You have been very methodical and analytical, and I'm sure that approach results in excellent hires for your firm.' In other words, pay them a sincere compliment that they can believe because it's anchored in the behavior you've just seen."
